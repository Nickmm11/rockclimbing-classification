Our idea is to classify head movements during rock climbing. The application of this project is to attempt to classify differences in head movements utilizing sensor logger data and the Airpod accelerometer. This project will be important for further implementation of optimizing climbing techniques and analyzing data for better performance. The main sensors we plan to use are the accelerometer (x,y,z) on the AirPods functions. The main feature we may be looking at is differences in head movements/jitting. Our plan for collecting data to evaluate our data is to have 2-4 people do a climb 5 times and video recording at the same time to more easily mark important timestamps. We plan to have 2 climbers who are more experienced to attempt the same climb and record in a similar fashion to get data for classification.
	To complement our approach, we aim to explore patterns in the accelerometer data that correlate with distinct climbing styles or levels of expertise. By focusing on the nuances of head movements—such as frequency, amplitude, and smoothness—we hope to identify features that distinguish experienced climbers from novices. Additionally, we will consider temporal features, such as the duration of sustained movements or pauses, as these may reflect differences in planning or execution during the climb. By extracting meaningful metrics like acceleration variance, peak counts, and motion symmetry, we can enhance the robustness of our classification model. This analysis could provide actionable insights for climbers looking to refine their techniques or for coaches designing training programs.
